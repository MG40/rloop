      The global technology industry is experiencing a growing demand for women coders as it seeks to better represent its diverse user base through inclusive teams and products. Around the world, organizations are initiating programs to encourage women and girls to pursue careers in coding. The aim is to enhance women's participation in software development and other STEM fields, leveraging the unique skills, creativity, and perspectives that women bring. By increasing women's involvement in technology globally, the development process becomes more inclusive and reflective of user needs, leading to innovations that resonate with a wide range of people.

      Despite progress, women remain underrepresented in technology roles worldwide. According to UNESCO, women constitute approximately 35% of all students enrolled in STEM-related fields globally. In engineering, they represent 28%, and in information and communication technology, just 3%. The World Economic Forum reports that women make up only 26% of professionals in artificial intelligence globally. These statistics highlight a significant gender gap in the tech industry, emphasizing the need for efforts to promote gender equality in STEM fields across the globe.

      Historical contributions of women to technology are evident internationally. Ada Lovelace from England is often recognized as the world's first computer programmer for her work in the 19th century. In the mid-20th century, Hedy Lamarr, an Austrian-American actress and inventor, contributed to the development of frequency-hopping spread spectrum technology, a precursor to modern wireless communication technologies like Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. In China, the 18th-century astronomer Wang Zhenyi made significant strides in understanding eclipses and celestial movements, challenging the gender norms of her time.

      Educational pathways for coders vary globally. Some pursue university degrees in computer science, while others attend coding bootcamps or engage in online courses. Coding bootcamps have emerged worldwide as flexible and accessible means to acquire programming skills. These programs are particularly beneficial for women who may face barriers in traditional educational settings due to cultural, economic, or social factors. Challenges remain, such as ensuring global recognition of bootcamp certifications and maintaining high educational standards across different regions.

      Women choose careers in coding for various reasons, including the desire to drive innovation, solve societal challenges, and contribute to the global economy. Coding offers opportunities for creative expression and problem-solving within a rapidly growing industry. Additionally, coding careers often provide competitive salaries and flexible working arrangements, appealing to women balancing professional and personal responsibilities.

      Numerous global organizations support women in coding and technology. The Anita Borg Institute, with an international reach, organizes the Grace Hopper Celebration, one of the world's largest gatherings of women technologists. Women in Technology International offers resources, networking opportunities, and advocacy for women across the globe. Technovation invites girls worldwide to learn and apply skills needed to solve real-world problems through technology. Girls in Tech operates in over 50 countries, focusing on engagement, education, and empowerment.
