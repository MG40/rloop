Returning to the IT workforce as a system administrator after a break is a commendable decision, and your prior experience is a valuable asset. To navigate your return to the industry, consider updating your technical skills by assessing the changes that have occurred during your absence. Technology evolves rapidly, so familiarize yourself with the latest trends in system administration, such as cloud computing, virtualization, automation, and cybersecurity. Online learning platforms like Coursera, Udemy, and LinkedIn Learning offer courses that can help you refresh and expand your knowledge in areas like Linux administration, Windows Server management, and especially cloud services like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which have become integral to modern IT infrastructure.

Earning relevant certifications can enhance your credentials and demonstrate your commitment to potential employers. Cloud certifications are particularly valuable in today's market. Consider pursuing certifications such as AWS Certified Solutions Architect – Associate, AWS Certified SysOps Administrator, Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate, Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect, or CompTIA Cloud+. These certifications validate your skills in deploying, managing, and operating systems on cloud platforms, which is increasingly important as organizations migrate to cloud-based solutions.

Leverage your previous experience by updating your resume to highlight your past roles and responsibilities, emphasizing your achievements and the impact you had in those positions. Many foundational system administration skills remain relevant, so draw parallels between your previous experience and current industry requirements, especially where they overlap with cloud technologies. To bridge any knowledge gaps, engage in hands-on practice by setting up a home lab environment where you can experiment with cloud services. Many cloud providers offer free tiers or trial accounts that allow you to practice deploying virtual machines, configuring networks, and managing storage solutions. Participating in open-source projects can also provide practical experience and showcase your skills to potential employers.

Networking professionally is crucial; reconnect with former colleagues to let them know you're returning to the field—they might have valuable leads or advice. Become active on professional platforms like LinkedIn, joining groups related to system administration and cloud computing, and attend industry events such as webinars, workshops, and local meetups to connect with other professionals and learn about opportunities. Consider exploring returnship programs offered by organizations to help professionals re-enter the workforce after a break. Programs like Outreachy provide paid, remote internships that support diversity in tech by connecting people from underrepresented groups, including women, with opportunities in open-source projects. Participating in such programs can offer valuable experience, help you update your skills, and expand your professional network.
